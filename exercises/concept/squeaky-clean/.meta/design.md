# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the `char` type.
- Know what a char represents (a Unicode character).
- Know that chars are immutable.
- Know how to define a char.
- Know how to access a char in a string by index.
- Know of some basic char methods (like converting to uppercase).
- Know how to convert an integer to a character and vice versa.

## Out of scope

- Converting a string to a char array.
- Handling control characters and `Char.IsControl` (this part of the C# exercise was removed for F#).

## Concepts

- `chars`: know of the existence of the char type; know what a char represents (a Unicode character); know that chars are immutable; know how to define a char; know how to access a char in a string by index; know of some basic char methods (like converting to uppercase); know how to convert an integer to a character and vice versa.

## Prerequisites

- `strings`: Strings are immutable objects representing text as a sequence of Unicode characters.
- `if-then-else-expressions`: The most common way to conditionally execute code in F# is via if/then/else expressions.
