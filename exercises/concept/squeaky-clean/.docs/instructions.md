# Instructions

In this exercise you will implement a partial set of utility routines to help a developer clean up identifier names.

In the 6 tasks you will gradually build up the functions `transform` to convert single characters and `clean` to convert strings.

A valid identifier comprises zero or more letters, underscores, hyphens, question marks and emojis.

If an empty string is passed to the `clean` function, an empty string should be returned.

## 1. Replace any hyphens encountered with underscores

Implement the `transform` function to replace any hyphens with underscores.

```fsharp
transform '-'  // => "_"
```

## 2. Remove all whitespace

Remove all whitespace characters.
This will include leading and trailing whitespace.

```fsharp
transform ' '  // => ""
```

## 3. Convert camelCase to kebab-case

Modify the `transform` function to convert camelCase to kebab-case

```fsharp
transform 'D'  // => "-d"
```

## 4. Omit characters that are digits

Modify the `transform` function to omit any characters that are numeric.

```fsharp
transform '7'  // => ""
```

## 5. Replace Greek lower case letters with question marks

Modify the `transform` function to replace any Greek letters in the range 'Î±' to 'Ï‰'.

```fsharp
transform 'Î²' // => "?"
```

## 6. Combine these operations to operate on a string

Implement the `clean` function to apply these operations to an entire string.

Characters which fall outside the rules should pass through unchanged.

```fsharp
clean "  a2b Cd-Ï‰ðŸ˜€  " //  => "ab-cd_?ðŸ˜€"
```

## Assembling a string from characters

This topic will be covered in detail later in the syllabus.

For now, it may be useful to know that there is a [higher order function][higher-order-function] called [`String.collect`][string-collect] that converts a collection of `char`s to a string, using a function that you supply.

```fsharp
let transform ch = $"{ch}_"
String.collect transform "abc"  // =>  "a_b_c_"
```
