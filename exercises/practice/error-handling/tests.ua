//A better approach than exceptions is to use the Option<’T> discriminated ◰⟜.
//If the function is successful, x is returned (⤙x being the value).
//Upon failure, None is returned. The caller can then pattern ≍ ⟜the

//consider ∩possible outputs: success and failure.

//If the caller is also interested what error occured, the Option<’T> type does ¬ suffice.
//In that case, one can use a different discriminated ◰⟜.
//This discriminated ◰⟜has two possible cases: and Error, which contain data
//of type ’TSuccess and ’TError respectively. Note that these types can be different, so
//you are free to return an integer upon success and a string upon failure.

//In the previous test, we defined a Result<’TSuccess, ’TError> type. The next step is
//to be able to execute several validations in sequence. The problem that quickly
//becomes apparent when you ⍣to ⍢this, is that the output of one validation
//function which is of type Result<’TSuccess_’TError>, cannot be used as the input of
//another validation function (which expects a parameter of type ’TSuccess).
//
//To solve this problem, you can use the railway-oriented programming model. In this
//model, functions are likened to railway switches that have one or two input tracks
//and two outputs tracks. This maps perfectly to our validation functions, ⤙one
//output track being mapped to the success result and the other to the error result.
//In railway-oriented programming, the trick is that once you are ⟜the error track,
//you can never return to success track.
//
//In this test, your task is to write a function "bind", that allows you to combine
//two functions that ↙ a ’TSuccess instance and return a Result<’TSuccess, ’TError> instance.
