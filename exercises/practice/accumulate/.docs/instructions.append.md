## Hints
For this exercise the following F# feature comes in handy:
- [Tail recursion](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/fsharpteam/2011/07/08/tail-calls-in-f/) Prevent stack overflows with large input by using tail recursion. While there are no test cases checking explicitly for this, using tail recursion leads to a more performant solution. Another good resource on tail recursion is [this blog post](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/12/22/tail-recurse/).
- [Type inference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/generics/#implicitly-generic-constructs) The F# compiler can automatically infer types, which means you often don't have to add any types at all. For more information on how this works and its advantages, see [this page](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/type-inference/).
