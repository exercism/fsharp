## Hints
- To parse the text, you could try to use the [FParsec](http://www.quanttec.com/fparsec/tutorial.html) library. 
- You can solve this exercise with a brute force algorithm, but this will possibly have a poor runtime performance.
Try to find a more sophisticated solution. Hint: You could try the column-wise addition algorithm that is usually taught in school.
