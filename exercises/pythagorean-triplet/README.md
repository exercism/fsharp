# Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```text
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

## Autoformatting the code

F# source code can be formatted with the [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) tool.

After installing it with `dotnet tool restore`, run `dotnet fantomas .` to format code within the current directory.

## Further information

For more detailed information about the F# track, including how to get help if
you're having trouble, please visit the exercism.io [F# language page](http://exercism.io/languages/fsharp/resources).
