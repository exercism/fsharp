overview of poker hands.

## Hints
- [Designing with types](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/designing-with-types.html) To come up with a clean and easy to read solution for this make sure to choose the right types to represent the different parts of the problem (think of suits, values, cards, etc)

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

## Autoformatting the code

F# source code can be formatted with the [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) tool.

After installing it with `dotnet tool restore`, run `dotnet fantomas .` to format code within the current directory.

## Further information
