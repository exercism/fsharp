# Anagram

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.

## Autoformatting the code

F# source code can be formatted with the [Fantomas](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas) tool.

After installing it with `dotnet tool restore`, run `dotnet fantomas .` to format code within the current directory.
