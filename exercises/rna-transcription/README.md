# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Hints
For this exercise the following F# feature comes in handy:
- [Match Expressions](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/match-expression/) While this can be solved using a dictionary, using a match expression is more idiomatic.

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the command `dotnet test` from within the exercise directory.
