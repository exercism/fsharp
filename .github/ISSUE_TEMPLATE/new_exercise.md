There is a new exercise, [EXERCISE-NAME](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/blob/main/exercises/EXERCISE-NAME/description.md), which data can be found here: https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/tree/main/exercises/EXERCISE-NAME

To implement the `EXERCISE-NAME` exercise, first run the `./add-practice-exercise EXERCISE-NAME` script.
This will create the exercise's files and output what remains to be done.
